## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
From the course, I have learnt to extract business rule from data using inductive reasoning. I have successfully enhanced the KIE home loan system using the discovered knowledge. The exact detail of the changes I have made is further explained under Section 6.

Towards the end of the project, I have exported my project to github and IVLE system for the individual project submission.
